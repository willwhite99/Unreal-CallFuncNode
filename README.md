# Unreal Call Function Node

Simple blueprint node that allows calling a function on an object by it's name. Currently does not support return types.

# Installing from source
Download the repo as a zip or download a release with prebuilt binaries, and extract it under your project Plugins folder so you have YourProject/Plugins/CallFuncNode/CallFuncNode.uplugin
Afterwards you will need to enable the plugin from the Plugins window.

Currently only have binaries for 4.27.1 (not test on 4.27.0), other versions will require building manually.
