# Installing from source
Download the repo as a zip or download a release with prebuilt binaries, and extract it under your project Plugins folder so you have YourProject/Plugins/CallFuncNode/CallFuncNode.uplugin

Afterwards you will need to enable the plugin from the Plugins window.

Currently only have binaries for 4.27.1 (not test on 4.27.0), other versions will require building manually.
